Tools to get lists of Minecraft block IDs and entity IDs

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts to automatically generate lists of block and entity IDs for specific Minecraft versions. These lists are saved as Python files, where each ID is represented as a constant.

## Scripts

- `get_block_id.py`: Extracts block IDs from a specified Minecraft version's JAR file and saves them to a Python file (e.g., `block_1_21_4.py`).
- `get_entity_id.py`: Extracts entity IDs from a specified Minecraft version's JAR file and saves them to a Python file (e.g., `entity_1_21_4.py`).

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Python 3.11 or later.
    - A Minecraft installation with the desired version.

2. **Run the scripts:**

    ```bash
    python get_block_id.py <Minecraft version>
    python get_entity_id.py <Minecraft version>
    ```

    Replace `<Minecraft version>` with the actual version (e.g., `1.21.4`).

    Example:

    ```bash
    python get_block_id.py 1.21.4
    python get_entity_id.py 1.21.4
    ```

3. **Output:**
    - The scripts will create files named `block_<version>.py` and `entity_<version>.py` in the same directory as the scripts.
    - These files will contain the block and entity IDs as Python constants.

## Example Output (block_1_21_4.py)

```python
# Block ID list of Minecraft 1.21.4
#   auto-generated by get_block_id.py as block_1_21_4.py

ACACIA_BUTTON = "acacia_button"
ACACIA_DOOR = "acacia_door"
ACACIA_FENCE = "acacia_fence"
# ... other block IDs ...
```

## Example Output (entity_1_21_4.py)

```python
# Entity ID list of Minecraft 1.21.4
#   auto-generated by get_entity_id.py as entity_1_21_4.py

ALLAY = "allay"
ARMADILLO = "armadillo"
ARMOR_STAND = "armor_stand"
# ... other entity IDs ...
```
